3rd Party
=========
This directory contains 3rd-party source code, which is included with Nano but is
covered by its own licence agreement.

Any code in this area is under a licence that is at least as permissive as Nano's
licence (e.g., is either public domain, also under the BSD licence, or under a
compatible licence such as MIT).

As such, it can be used as per Nano's source code with no additional requirements.
