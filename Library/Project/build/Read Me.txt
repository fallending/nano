Xcode builds can be performed with build products placed in the project
folder, or to a shared build area.


To allow Nano to build with a fresh install, irrespective of your build
products preference, the Nano .xcconfig files are set up to include
these Debug/Release folders in the library search paths.

This ensures that any projects using the .xcconfig files and per-product
build areas can find the Nano libraries automatically, without forcing
them to add a library search path to each project.


If you build to a shared build area then this directory would not normally
exist. This then causes the linker will emit a warning about a non-existent
library search path, since the .xcconfig files can not adjust their behaviour
based on the build product preference.

There does not appear to be any flag to suppress this warning, and so this
directory has been added to ensure that it always exists even if is not used
for builds.
