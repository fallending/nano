<h1>Building Nano</h1>
<p>
Nano is typically built with Xcode 3 for Mac/iPhone, and Microsoft Visual C++ Express 2008
for Windows.
</p>

<p>
However the code should build with any reasonably modern C++ compiler, such as gcc 4.x or
later.
</p>



<h2>Xcode</h2>
<h3>Configuration</h3>
<p>
All Nano projects contain Debug, Release, and Distribution configurations.
</p>

<p>
These configurations obtain their values from external .xcconfig files, contained in
<tt>Support/Xcode/Configuration</tt>.
</p>

<p>
These .xcconfig files maximize warnings in debug builds, and minimize the final binary size in
release/distribution builds. The details of each configuration can be adjusted to meet your own
needs, since Nano does not require these particular choices.
</p>

<p>
By default, debug builds are performed for the current architecture while release builds are
built as Universal Binaries. This behaviour can be changed by adjusting the <tt>ARCHS</tt>
setting in the .xcconfig files.
</p>


<h3>Projects</h3>
<p>
Nano projects do not apply any settings at the project level, and are customized at the
target level. Targets contain minimal customisations, with most configuration performed
through .xcconfig files.
</p>

<p>
Nano is typically built as a stand-alone static library, however this style of build is
not required. Nano can also be built by including the relevant source code directly in
your project, or by building it into a framework/shared library.
</p>


<h3>Language</h3>
<p>
If compiling Nano source directly in your project, you will need to apply the correct
language settings to individual source files; all source should be built as C++, except
those .cpp files which also contain Objective-C.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately a bug in Xcode (<a href="rdar://5259110">rdar://5259110</a>) means that the
per-file language setting is ignored if the target-level language setting is set to anything
other than "by file type".
</p>

<p>
As such, you will need to set the language setting individually for those files who do not
match Xcode's extension-based rules (.c files must be modified to C++, and .cpp files that
use Objective-C must be set to Obj-C++).
</p>



<h2>Visual C++</h2>
<p>
Nano should build with Microsoft Visual C++ Express 2008 or later.
</p>
