<h1>High Performance</h1>
<p>
Nano aims to promote high-performance development, both at run-time and during the development process.
</p>

<p>
It does this by making it easy to write simple, yet efficient, code.
</p>



<h2>Simpler Code</h2>
<p>
Nano aims to minimise and simplify the code needed for common tasks.
</p>

<p>
This example compares some simple string manipulation with the equivalent Objective-C:
</p>

<div class="box_code_yellow">void CObject::SomeMethod(const NString &theString)
{   NString   otherString;
 
    otherString  = theString;  
    otherString += " World!";
    
    if (theString == "Hello")
        CFShowStr(ToCF(otherString));
}

<hr width="80%">
- (void) someMessage:(const NSString *) theString
{   NSMutableString   *otherString = nil;

    otherString = [theString mutableCopyWithZone:nil];
    [otherString appendString:@" World!"];
    
    if ([theString isEqualToString:@"Hello"])
        CFShowStr((CFStringRef) otherString);

    [otherString release];
}</div>

<p>
As well as being less verbose, notable differences are:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Since Cocoa has two string classes, each variable must be explicitly declared as immutable
	or mutable. Nano provides a single NString object, which becomes mutable as needed (allowing
	<tt>const</tt> to enforce const-ness at compile-time).</li>
	<br>

	<li>Although it is overwritten in this example, local variables such as otherString must be
	explicitly initialized in Objective-C. Nano objects are always initialised to a sensible default
	(such as an empty string).</li>
	<br>
	
	<li>NString provides '<tt>=</tt>' and '<tt>+=</tt>' operators, allowing a more natural syntax for
	string manipulation.</li>
	<br>
	
	<li>Objects derived from NComparable, such as NString, only need to implement one method to obtain the
	full set of comparison operators (<tt>==</tt>, <tt>!=</tt>, <tt>&lt=</tt>, <tt>&lt;</tt>, <tt>&gt;</tt>, <tt>&gt;=</tt>).</li>
	<br>
	
	<li>Objects derived from NSharedValue, such as NString, use a copy-on-write model for data. This
	allows otherString to be assigned theString, yet defer copying theString's data until otherString
	is modified. In Objective-C, otherString must duplicate theString if it could potentially be
	modified (even if that modification is inside a branch which never occurs).</li>
	<br>
	
	<li>A set of 'Nanite' headers provide overloaded functions to convert between Nano types and other APIs.
	Rather than having to explicitly specify the type being cast to, ToCF automatically invokes the appropriate
	function to convert a Nano object to the equivalent CoreFoundation object.</li>
	<br>
	
	<li>Nano uses the '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Acquisition_Is_Initialization">RAII</a>'
	design pattern to minimise pointer management, allowing otherString to release its string when it
	goes out of scope. This must be managed manually in Objective-C, or handled with garbage collection
	(which can reclaim pointers, but not resources such as open files) or ARC (which can require special
	casts to inform the compiler about object lifetimes).</li>
	<br>
</ul>



<h2>Simpler Multithreading</h2>
<p>
Nano provides a cross-platform interface to the native thread API, and a set of synchronization primitives
such as locks (mutex, read-write, and spin) and atomic operations (integers, lists, or arithmetic).
</p>

<p>
<tt>NThreadPool</tt> manages a thread pool for <tt>NThreadTask</tt> objects, and automatically distributes
tasks across the available CPUs. Tasks are normally scheduled by priority, but <tt>NThreadPool</tt> can also
use FIFO, LIFO, or custom schedulers.
</p>

<p>
Individual functors can be spun off onto threads, and threads can pass functors back to the main thread if
they need to access to non-thread-safe APIs.
</p>



<h2>Simpler Sockets</h2>
<p>
Nano provides a cross-platform interface to the native sockets API, and a set of tools for building network
applications (such as a key-value based message system, or ZeroConf discovery).
</p>

<p>
<tt>NSocket</tt> is a thin wrapper around the most efficient network layer for each platform, and abstracts
the differences in behaviour between notify-on-ready (CFSocket) and notify-on-completion (IOCP) APIs.
</p>

<p>
<tt>NMessageClient</tt> and <tt>NMessageServer</tt> allow multiple clients to connect to a server, and
communicate using compressed key-value messages (with comparable performance to Protocol Buffers).
</p>



<h2>Copy-On-Write</h2>
<p>
Many of Nano's core types derive from NSharedValue, which provides lock-free copy-on-write behaviour. This
allows objects such as strings or dictionaries to be copied extremely efficiently.
</p>

<p>
NSharedValue allows objects to be passed around with very little overhead, as even objects passed by value
are effectively passed as const references until they are actually modified.
</p>

<p>
This approach also allows Nano to provide a single object of each type (e.g., NString), rather than two
classes for the same concept (such as separate classes for mutable vs immutable strings).
</p>

<p>
Immutable objects are "copied" simply by incrementing their reference count, and are converted to a mutable
form automatically as required.
</p>



<h2>Inline Functions</h2>
<p>
By judicious use of inline functions, Nano allows performance-critical code to preserve type safety while
removing any function call overhead:
</p>

<div class="box_code_yellow">NIndex CountBits(const NBitVector &theBits)
{   NIndex    n, numBits, numSet;

    numBits = theBits.GetSize();
    numSet  = 0;   

    for (n = 0; n < numBits; n++)
        {
        if (theBits.GetBit(n))
            numSet++;
        }
    
    return(numSet);
}</div>

<p>
Since GetBit is an inline function, the inner loop can obtain direct access to the bits in the
vector without going through a real function call.
</p>

<p>
However since GetBits is declared as a function, it can still ensure const-correctness and be
stepped into for debugging.
</p>
