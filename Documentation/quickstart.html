<h1>Quick Start Guide</h1>
<p>
Although Nano does not require an installer, additional Xcode integration can be installed with:
</p>

<div class="box code">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cd /Developer/Nano<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perl Support/Scripts/XcodeExtras.pl
</div>

<p>
This script will update your Xcode installation to include a source tree to your Nano installation,
templates for creating new Nano-based projects, and additional debugging macros for gdb.
</p>

<p>
Running this script is strongly recommended, as it allows you to create Nano-based projects from
within Xcode and to rebuild the demo projects.
</p>



<h2>Creating a Project</h2>
<p>
To create your first Nano-based project, run the XcodeExtras.pl script as above and then launch Xcode.
</p>

<p>
Select "New Project" from the File menu, and then "Nano Document-based Application":
</p>

<div align=center>
<img src="html/demo_new.png" alt="Demo New" width="588" height="520">
</div>

<p>
Call the new project "Demo App", and Xcode will create a new document-based application that
uses the Nano framework. 
</p>

<p>
If you are using the "Condensed" view in Xcode, the project file will look something like:
</p>

<div align=center>
<img src="html/demo_project.png" alt="Demo Project" width="396" height="410">
</div>

<p>
Select "Build & Run", and Xcode will build the Nano library and the demo application. Once the
application has been built, it will be launched:

<div align=center>
<img src="html/demo_app.png" alt="Demo App" width="442" height="546">
</div>

<p>
Use the File menu to create multiple documents, modify their content with the color picker
or the Info sheet, and experiment with saving, loading, or printing documents.
</p>

<p>
Congratulations - you have built your first Nano application!
</p>



<h2>Examining the Demo</h2>
<p>
The template Nano projects are designed to act as a starting point for your own projects, and to
demonstrate the typical structure of a Nano-based application.
</p>

<p>
The best way to familiarise yourself with them is to examine the code, which will allow you to see
which features are provided by the framework and how applications can customise the standard
behaviour.
</p>

<p>
However, some points of interest are discussed below.
</p>


<h3>Application Features</h3>
<p>
The demo application sub-classes Nano's standard NApplication class with the CApplication object.
</p>

<p>
This class inherits most of its interesting behaviour from NApplication, and is responsible for
defining standard values and performing tasks such as instantiating a new document.
</p>

<p>
These "standard values" are stored in a dictionary of properties, which is used by the base class to
perform tasks such as registering a Help Book, populating the About Box, or initialising the default
values for the preferences.
</p>

<p>
Additional tasks handled by NApplication include creating or closing documents, handling Apple Events
from the Finder, and creating standard windows such as the About Box or Preferences window.
</p>



<h3>Document Features</h3>
<p>
The demo application sub-classes Nano's standard NDocument class with the CWindowDocument object.
</p>

<p>
As before, this class inherits most of its behaviour from the framework - its main responsibilities
are to provide information to the base class and to handle application-specific commands.
</p>

<p>
The base class manages the overall document model, and includes support for saving, loading, and
reverting documents.
</p>

<p>
By default, documents are saved in a cross-platform file format based on key-value encoding. This
ensures that saved documents are always forwards and backwards compatible, and allows NDocument to
archive its own state (such as the position of the document window) alongside the application-specific
content added by CWindowDocument.
</p>

<p>
NDocument, in cooperation with NApplication, also prompts the user to save (or review) changes to
modified documents when closing documents or quitting the application. Saved documents are tracked
with an alias, allowing the document window's title to update automatically if the document is
renamed in the Finder.
</p>

<p>
NDocument also provides printing support, managing the user interface and overall job control.
Sub-classes simply need to render each page in turn, or nominate a single view that will be
automatically scaled to fit on the printed page.
</p>
